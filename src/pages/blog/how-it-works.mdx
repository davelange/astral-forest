# How it works
Astro accepts .md or, in this case, .mdx files, as valid routes, as long as they are in the /pages directory.
Forestry is a git based CMS, so it stores pages directly in a connected repo.
We can combine these two - saving pages directly to the pages directory. We can specify a template in the frontmatter, so Astro will render the page correctly.
